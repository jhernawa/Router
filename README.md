Basic Network Router

This router handles the ping and traceroute requests from a client to servers, or to its own interfaces.
Furthermore, it allows the users to download a file using HTTP from one of the app servers.

It can also generate the appropriate ICMP messages to the client to indicate any error that happens during
the packets forwarding
